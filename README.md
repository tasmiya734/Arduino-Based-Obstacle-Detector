# Arduino-Based-Obstacle-Detector
This project aims to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings using an IoT-based obstacle detection system. The wearable device detects obstacles and provides auditory feedback, enhancing mobility and independence.

# Features
- *Obstacle Detection*: Detects objects up to 30 cm and alerts with continuous beeping.
- *Portable Design*: Lightweight and user-friendly glasses.
- *Real-time Feedback*: Alerts users of immediate dangers or nearby objects.
The code is written in Arduino C++ and can be uploaded directly to the Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE.

# How to Upload Code
1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Copy the code from the code.ino file in this repository.
3. Connect the Arduino to your computer and upload the code.

#Future Enhancements
- Haptic Feedback: Add vibration alerts.
- GPS Navigation: Include location-based assistance.
- Bluetooth: Integrate advanced notifications.
